    "*e.g., Telecom Churn Prediction*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "*You are working for a Telecommunications provider. They are losing customers to competitors, but they don't know who is likely to leave. They want you to build a model to predict churn (1 = Customer Leaves, 0 = Customer Stays). The Catch: Most customers are happy. Only a small percentage actually churn. If your model just predicts \"Stays\" for everyone, you'll get high accuracy but provide zero business value.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:**  \n",
    "*Synthetic dataset generated internally.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Are there any missing values, significant outliers or class imbalance that needs to be addressed?*\n",
    "* *Which features are most predictive of customer churn?*\n",
    "* *What is the expected accuracy of the churn prediction model?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Metrics:**  \n",
    "*Recall (How many churners did we catch?) and F1-Score.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Success Criteria*\n",
    "*Target: Achieve an F1-Score (for Class 1) > 0.70.*\n",

    "##### Test Model Assumptions 🌲\n",
    "\n",
    "After developing your random forest model, consider the following best practices and checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sufficient Sample Size**\n",
    "- Adequate data to create meaningful splits across multiple trees\n",
    "- *Ensure sufficient observations per terminal node across the forest*\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Feature Relevance**\n",
    "- Important features are included; irrelevant features may dilute performance\n",
    "- *Review feature importance scores and remove low-impact features*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Check for Overfitting**\n",
    "- Model may memorize training patterns despite ensemble averaging\n",
    "- *Use out-of-bag (OOB) error, cross-validation, or limit n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Handle Class Imbalance (Classification)**\n",
    "- Severe imbalance can bias predictions toward majority class\n",
    "- *Use class_weight='balanced', balanced_subsample, or SMOTE*\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. No Multicollinearity Requirement**\n",
    "- Random forests handle correlated features naturally through random feature selection\n",
    "- *Note: Correlated features may affect feature importance interpretation*\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Interpretability Considerations**\n",
    "- Feature importance may favor high-cardinality or continuous variables\n",
    "- *Review importance scores critically, validate with domain knowledge, and consider permutation importance*\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- Model performance depends on proper parameter selection\n",
    "- *Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features*\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Validation Strategy**\n",
    "- Always evaluate on holdout/test set to assess generalization\n",
    "- *Check for data leakage and ensure train/test split is representative*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Random Forests:**\n",
    "- No distributional assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity not required)\n",
    "- Robust to outliers due to ensemble averaging and threshold-based splits\n",
    "- Handles missing values (some implementations)\n",
    "- Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions automatically\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tip: Document any assumption violations and mitigation steps for transparency and reproducibility.*"
